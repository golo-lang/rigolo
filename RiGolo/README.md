# RiGolo: Purpose and Guidelines

This document is heavily inspired by [python's PEP 1][PEP1]

## What is a *RiGolo*?

A RiGolo is a *Request for Improvement of Golo*. It's a design document describing a new Golo feature, a protocol, or a standardized API. The RiGolo should provide a concise technical specification, as well as a rationale and motivation.

The main purpose of the RiGolo is to collect community input and document the design decisions.

## RiGolo Workflow

### Golo BDFL

This acronym stands for "Benevolent Dictator for Life" and refers to Julien Ponge [@jponge](https://github.com/jponge), the original creator of, and the final design authority for, the Golo programming language.
